		 * GOAL: Make a math game that has 4 rounds and a point system
		 * 			The game should get progressively harder as the user answers correctly
		 * 				or easier if they miss questions
		 * 			Harder questions = more points and easier questions = less points
		 * 
		 * ROUND 1: Add two two digit numbers, preferably between the integers 1-20
		 * 				If correct, award 5 points and make next question harder
		 * 				If wrong, award 0 points and repeat question difficulty
		 * 
		 * ROUND 2: Subtract a three digit number from a 4 digit number
		 * 				If correct, award 10 points and make next question harder
		 * 				If wrong, award 2 points and make next question easier
		 * 
		 * ROUND 3: Add two two digit numbers less then fifty then multiply by a 2 digit number
		 * 				If correct, award 17 points and make next question harder
		 * 				If wrong, award 7 points and make next question easier
		 * 
		 * ROUND 4: Add two 2 digit numbers less then 50 to get number 1, subtract a 2 digit 
		 * 			number from a 1 digit number to get number 2, then multiply number 1 by number 2
		 * 				If correct, award 26 points and tell user their score
		 * 				If wrong, award 15 points and tell user their score
